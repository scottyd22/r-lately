<a href="https://sdavis.shinyapps.io/r_lately/" target="_blank">R Lately</a> is a shiny app that consolidates some of my favorite resources for new R content into one location. 

Each time the app is launched, various R-inspired blogs are scraped and CRAN events searched for the most up-to-date information.
